# CodeKata_GCruzJoa
Code Katas Solutions

This is a repository for the .cs of the Code Katas that I have to do for the class "Tendencias en desarrollo de aplicaciones" or "Trends in application development". All of these Katas are from the website http://codingdojo.org/

In this repository you can see the codes of each Kata that I have made, which are:
  Roman Numerals
  Numbers in words
  String Calculator
  Range
